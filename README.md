Clocks
======

A simple analog and digital clock using HTML5 canvas and javascript apis.

The hvclocks.html defines a canvas of width and height 300. It also defines two buttons to shift between the analog and 
the digital version of the clock.

The hvclocks.js defines the javascript functions to draw the analog and digital clocks in the canvas.
